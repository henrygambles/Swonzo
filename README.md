**ðŸš§ Please note: As Monzo is currently making its API compliant with FCA Strong Customer Authentication - the protcols around third-party applications are currently in flux. Swonzo will be releasing an update once these changes have finsihed taking place. Thank you! ðŸš§**

**Login**

When looking at how best to implement login for users - there were some decisions needed to be made.

Data from Monzo's API can be accessed by either:
a) Requesting a token from https://developers.monzo.com, and using this token as parameters to request further information about that account.
b) Implementing the OAuth authorisation process whereby a user opens the app to login, then are redirected to Monzo to sign in to their account 

  to build my own login functionality rather than using OAuth.

Presented its own set of challenges - as in order to get a user's balance or transactions - the API first needs to know what the account ID is.
- The moment a token is entered into Swonzo, 3 requests are made in quick succession:
- A user inputs their token
- OAuth
