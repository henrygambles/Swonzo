## What's This?

Swonzo is an iOS client for the Monzo API writen in Swift!

Built in Xcode using Alamofire, Charts, Disk, Google Maps & Lottie.

**ðŸš§ Please note: As Monzo is currently making its API compliant with FCA Strong Customer Authentication - the protcols around third-party applications are currently in flux. Swonzo will be releasing an update once these changes have finsihed taking place. Thank you! ðŸš§**

## Learning Documentation

**Overview**

This project was built in order to learn more about creating complex iOS apps, handling data from an API and what makes for great UX.

Swonzo was never explicitly devleoped for public use (Monzo states at the top of its API documentation that the "Monzo Developer API is not suitable for building public applications") - though I was keen to make Swonzo capable of handling data from any Monzo account.

I really enjoyed and learnt a lot from building Swonzo.

**UX**

When I started building Swonzo - I didn't think it would be nessecary to persist data within the app using a database or otherise, as it only took about 20 seconds to load & render a user's entire transaction history. Instead, I placed relevent loading animations in the Home, Maps, & Transactions Tab - letting the user know that Swonzo was loading their data.

Whilst animations which keep the user informed of what is happening behind the scenes whilst they wait are a good way to account for this - I found that in the context of mobile applications - any waiting time over 10 seconds tends to frustrate the user, and so I set out to fix this by saving the transaction history to the device using Disk.

**Login**

When looking at how best to implement login for users - there were some decisions needed to be made. Data from Monzo's API can be accessed by either:

a) Requesting a token from https://developers.monzo.com, and using this token as parameters to request further information about that account.<br>
b) Implementing the OAuth authorisation process where a user opens the app to login, are redirected to Monzo to sign in to their account, then redirected back to the app with their API credentials stored. 

Knowing this, I decided to build my own login functionality following the process described in option a) - rather than using the OAuth cycle. This presented its own set of challenges, as in order to any information about a user's transactions or balance - the API first needs more information about the account. To do this, the moment a token is entered into Swonzo, 3 requests are made in quick succession to fetch all the data:

- Firstly - Swonzo makes a request to https://api.monzo.com/accounts to fetch the account ID needed for further requests.
- Then, a request is made with these updatec parameters to https://api.monzo.com/transactions to fetch all data associated with transactions made by the user.
- Simultaneously, a request is made to https://api.monzo.com/balance to fetch data around user's balance.

Originally, this would all happen in the backend whilst presenting a seamless segue to the user; though, since the introduction of Strong Customer Authentication - it is now the case that third-party applications such as Swonzo need to be authorised in the manner outined above in option b).

Considering the obviously sensitive nature of personal banking information - it makes sense to use the OAuth flow. The tradeoff between these two options can be seen in the cartoon below ðŸ‘‡

## Testing

Where possible, I wanted to build Swonzo using TDD, and used Xcode's own XCTest functionality to do this.
